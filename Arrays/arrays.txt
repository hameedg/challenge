An Array is a collection of items of same datatype
Array is not only the data structures there are other such as linked list, cll, vector
But how array is different from others?
Array are typically stored at contiguous memory locations
Array elements are accessed as indexes
----------arr[i]----------
Advantages od contiguous:
random access--->you can call any indexed elements---->O(1)
cache friendly(fastest memory)--->they prefetch nearby items

Types of Arrays:
Fixed-->
arr[n],
arr[100], 
int *arr= new int[n],
arr[]={10,3,2,5}
Dynamic--->
(vector)

Vectors::
why vectors?
everything was perfect like static and dynamic arrays but why another container as Vectors

Reason:
The Dynamic arrays has a property as it make the current array double even when we need only 2 extra spaces 
so here are Vectors

advatages :
1. dynamic size
2. stl 

  conventional array size:        |  vector array size:
1.sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0])      |      v.size()
2.while declaring functions that  |        no need
contain arrays it goes like this  |            
                                  |
int func(int arr[],int n){}       |

operations on arrays::
insert 
O(n)
search
O(n) unsorted 
O(logn) sorted
delete 
O(n)
retrive 
O(1)
